> This project is my interpritation of the requriements stated in the test document.

This project has allowed me to better inprove my intrinsic understanding of arrays and loops, aswell as remember some of my techniques from HS IT. 

My understanding of these technologys were put to the test and improved by a large margin
  * PHP 
  * Arrays
  * SQLite
 
During the course this project I have used various resourses in order to gain a better grasp of these technologys aswell as for debuging.

They include:
* [SQLite Documentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/index.htm)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - To help debug my code.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - For understanding the functions needed.
* [PHP Docs](https://www.php.net/)
